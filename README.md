### Hi, I'm Ezra!

I'm a software engineer who specializes in real-time visualization and control of space robots and their supporting systems.

I'm:
- 💼 a Space Robotics Architect at SoftServe.
- 🚀 a leading member of the Space ROS project committee.
- 🕸️ a maintainer of the Robot Web Tools project.
- 👨‍💻 a writer of whatever language gets the job done. TypeScript, C/C++, C#/Java, Rust, Python, etc.
  - ⚛️ (but I have a soft spot for TypeScript and React)
